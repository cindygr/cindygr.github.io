@article{euro1998fse,doi={10.1111/1467-8659.00251}, note={Editing curves and surfaces is difficult in part because their mathematical representations rarely correspond to most people\\\s idea of a curve or surface. The implementation (and hence  behavior) of most manipulation tools is intertwined with a particular curve or surface representation; this can make reimplementing the tool with a different representation problematic. A system using a single representation must therefore either limit the types of tools available or convert existing tools to work on the system\\\s representation. In this paper we present a framework for editing curves or surfaces which supports multiple representations and ensures that they stay synchronized. As a proof of concept,  we have created a curve editor which contains several tools each of which manipulate one of three different curve representations: polylines,  NURBs,  and multi-resolution B-splines. }, title = {A Framework for Synchronized Editing of Multiple Curve Representations},journal = {Computer Graphics Forum},year = {1998},volume = {17},number = {3},pages = {31-40},author = {Grimm, Cindy and Ayers, Matthew}}
