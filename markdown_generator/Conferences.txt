11/2005	3D Screen-space Widgets for Non-linear Projection	g2005nl	Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Australasia and South East Asia 	"This paper lets the user specify multiple cameras using screen-space widgets. Linear perspective is a good approximation to the format in which the human visual system conveys 3D scene information to the brain. Artists expressing 3D scenes,  however,  create nonlinear projections that balance their linear perspective view of a scene with elements of aesthetic style,  layout and relative importance of scene objects. Manipulating the many parameters of a linear perspective camera to achieve a desired view is not easy. Controlling and combining multiple such cameras to specify a nonlinear projection is an even more cumbersome task. This paper presents a direct interface,  where an artist manipulates in 2D the desired projection of a few features of the 3D scene. The features represent a rich set of constraints which define the overall projection of the 3D scene. Desirable properties of local linear perspective and global scene coherence drive a heuristic algorithm that attempts to interactively satisfy the given constraints as a weight-averaged projection of a minimal set of linear perspective cameras. This paper shows that 2D feature constraints are a direct and effective approach to control both the 2D layout of scene objects and the conceptually complex,  high dimensional parameter space of nonlinear scene projection.

6/2005	Curvature Maps for Local Shape Comparison	smi2005cm	International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications 2005 (SMI\ 05)	"A local shape comparison technique for meshes, The ability to identify similarities between shapes is important for applications such as medical diagnosis,  object registration and alignment,  and shape retrieval. In this paper we present a method,  the  Curvature Map,  that uses surface curvature properties in a region around a point to create a unique signature for that point. These signatures can then be compared to determine the similarity of one point to another. To gather curvature information around a point we explore two techniques,  rings (which use the local topology of the mesh) and Geodesic Fans (which trace geodesics along the mesh from the point). We explore a variety of comparison functions and provide experimental evidence for which ones provide the best discriminatory power. We show that Curvature Maps are both more robust and provide better discrimination than simply comparing the curvature at individual points.

We define a manifold and a corresponding embedding function for three genera (plane,  sphere,  and torus).

9/2001	Post-rendering Composition for 3D Scenes	euro2001prc	Eurographics short papers	"Objects have their own cameras and lighting effects, In traditional art a painter displays a 3D scene on a 2D image plane in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing. The arrangement of objects and colors is called composition and is the subject of many art books and classes. While a painter may use perspective to create depth in a scene they may also alter the perspective and color,  either subtly or dramatically,  to influence the focus of viewer and the effect of the image. To date,  traditional 3D graphics packages have largely concentrated on modeling,  textures,  and lighting to create images and provide few tools for altering the composition post-rendering. In this paper we present several simple techniques for creating images with non-standard perspective and color using standard 3D rendering packages. The scene is modeled in 3D but each object has its own camera,  color balance,  and image size,  allowing the user to alter the composition after the 3D rendering step. The purpose of this paper is not to present a complete composition system but rather to illustrate the potential of composition-based tools.  composition,  lighting,  non-linear projection, "	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251473514_Post-rendering_Composition_for_3D_Scenes	http://cindygr.github.io/files/euro2001prc.pdf	Cindy Grimm	
10/1995	Visual Interfaces for Solids Modeling	uist1995vism	Proceedings of the 8th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface and Software Technology 	"Widgets for 3D surface editing,  This paper explores the use of visual operators for solids modeling. We focus on designing interfaces for free-form operators such as blends,  sweeps,  and deformations,  because these operators have a large number of interacting parameters whose effects are often determined by an underlying parameterization. In this type of interactive modeling good solutions to the design problem have aesthetic as well as engineering components. Traditionally,  interaction with the parameters of these operators has been through text editors,  curve editors,  or trial-and-error with a slider bar. Parametric values have been estimated from data,  but not interactively. These parameters are usually one- or two-dimensional,  but the operators themselves are intrinsically three-dimensional in that they are used to model surfaces visualized in 3D. The traditional textual style of interaction is tedious and interposes a level of abstraction between the parameters and the resulting surface. A 3D visual interface has the potential to reduce or eliminate these problems by combining parameters and representing them with a higher-level visual tool. The visual tools we present not only speed up the process of determining good parameter values but also provide visual interactions that are either independent of the particular parameterizations or make explicit the effect of the parameterizations. Additionally,  these tools can be manipulated in the same 3D space as the surfaces produced by the operators,  supporting quick,  interactive exploration of the large design space of these free-form operators. This paper discusses the difficulties in creating a coherent user interface for interactive modeling. To this end we present four principles for designing visual operators,  using several free-form visual operators as concrete examples.  3D surface editing,  computer aided geometric design, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/215585.215652	http://cindygr.github.io/files/uist1995vism.pdf	Cindy Grimm and David Pugmire and John Hughes and Mark Bloomenthal and Elaine Cohen

The technique inherits many of the properties of B-splines: local control,  a compact representation,  and guaranteed continuity of arbitrary degree. The surface is specified using a polyhedral control mesh instead of a rectangular one; the resulting surface approximates the polyhedral mesh much as a B-spline approximates its rectangular control mesh. Like a B-spline,  the surface is a single,  continuous object. This is achieved by modeling the domain of the surface with a manifold whose topology matches that of the polyhedral mesh,  then embedding this domain into 3-space using a basis-function/control-point formulation. We provide a constructive approach to building a manifold.  3D surface modeling and editing, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/218380.218475	http://cindygr.github.io/files/sig1995msat.pdf	Cindy Grimm and John Hughes

This surface is related to the sweep which is traditionally formed by an axis curve and one or more cross sections. Instead of cross sections,  this definition uses profile curves to define how far the surface is from the axis. This facilitates the construction of surfaces which have continually varying cross sections. We extend this definition to a generalized cylinder with two axis curves. This model is useful for surfaces where one side of the surface curves sharply away from the axis while the axis itself is curving.

6/2005	Table-top Computed Lighting for Practical Digital Photography	euro2005tl	Eurographics Symposium on Rendering	"Specifying lighting of real-world objects using a sketching approach. We apply simplified image-based lighting methods to reduce the equipment,  cost,  time,  and specialized skills required for high-quality photographic lighting of desktop-sized static objects such as museum artifacts. We place the object and a computer-steered moving-head spotlight inside a simple foam-core enclosure,  and use a camera to quickly record low-resolution photos as the light scans the box interior. Optimization guided by interactive user sketching selects a small set of frames whose weighted sum best matches the target image. The system then repeats the lighting used in each of these frames,  and constructs a high resolution result from re-photographed basis images. Unlike previous image-based re-lighting efforts,  our method requires only one light source,  yet can achieve high resolution light positioning to avoid multiple sharp shadows.

Previousapproaches often required some type of user interaction to select features.Manual selection of corresponding features and subjective determination of thedifference between objects are time consuming processes requiring a high levelof expertise. The Curvature Map represents shape information for a point and itssurrounding region and is robust with respect to grid resolution and mesh regularity.It can be used as a measure of local surface similarity.We use these curvaturemap properties to extract feature regions of an object. To make the selection of thefeature region less subjective,  we employ a min-cut/max-flow graph cut algorithmwith vertex weights derived from the curvature map property.

7/2006	The Effect of Warm and Cool Object Colors on Depth Ordering	apgv2006wc	Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization	"A study on the effect of color on depth. A longer version can be found <a href=\""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/166/\"">here</a>. Colors that appear closer to the red end of the visible spectrum are said to be warm while the colors that appear closer to the blue end are said to be cool. The phenomenon of warmer colors appearing nearer in depth to viewers than cooler colors has been studied extensively by psychologists and other vision researchers (see [Sundet 1978] for a summary). The vast majority of these studies have asked human observers to view physically equidistant,  colored stimuli and compare them for relative depth. However,  in most cases,  the stimuli presented were rather simple: straight colored lines,  uniformcolor patches,  point light sources,  or symmetrical objects with uniformshading. Additionally,  the colors used were typically highly saturated. Although such stimuli are useful in isolating and studying depth cues in certain contexts,  they leave open the question of whether the human visual system operates similarly for realistic objects.This paper presents the results of an experiment designed to explore the color-depth relationship for realistic,  colored objects with varying shading and contours.

In this work,  we present an interactive interface for sketching synthesized textures. Reaction-Diffusion (RD) is used as the basis for texture synthesis. RD allows an unlimited amount of non-repeating texture and offers great flexibility for mapping textures to arbitrary surfaces. However,  it can be difficult to find starting values of parameters that will produce interesting patterns. We use machine learning to resolve the difficulty of determining appropriate initial values of the RD system. The system described here allows a user to sketch a pattern of spots or stripes with arbitrary orientations,  and then automatically generates a pattern with the same attributes as the sketch. It also allows the user to interactively create more complex textures by adding another layer of pattern,  as well as manipulate the color of the resulting texture.

This paper presents a novel rendering technique inspired by artistic approaches. Instead of trying to recreate a traditional medium,  such as charcoal or watercolor,  this approach is a mixture of both photo-realism and abstraction. Artists use a process of abstraction to provide structural information about subjects that do not have clearly defined shapes,  such as groups of leaves in a tree. For example,  an artist will use a color wash to first approximate a group of leaves. They then add detail on top of parts of this wash to indicate the presence of individual leaves. Similarly,  we use an abstract shape that approximates the image of leaves clustered at the end of a branch. To prevent oversimplification,  we add photo-realistic detail using a blending process. Interframe coherence is achieved both by smoothly interpolating the abstract shapes,  and the continuity inherent inthe photo-realistically rendered detail.

11/2011	Bioinspiration from Biodiversity in Sensor Design	asme2011bio	ASME 2001 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	"Biological systems are organized along a hierarchy that ranges from bio-molecules to large-scale ecosystems. In the present work,  the level of biodiversity is considered as a source for engineering knowledge. In the process of evolution and adaptive radiation in particular,  common functional principles have been adapted to suit a multitude of tasks and constraints. The resulting biodiversity can hence be regarded as a source for inspiration on how a single functional principle can be adapted to suit the requirements of different applications. The biosonar systems of bats are an example for a biological sensing principle that has been adjusted to fit a multitude of sensing tasks. The unique combination of biosonar sensing and flight has allowed bats to settle almost the entire land surface of the earth and exploit a wide range of food sources that range from airborne insect prey to terrestrial vertebrates. The geometries of the mechanical baffles that surround the sides of sound emission and reception are a conspicuous correlate of this diversification in the uses of biosonar. Understand the principles that underlie this diversification,  requires an array of customized methods: First,  objective and quantitative descriptions are needed for the biological variation in irregular,  organic shapes at an inter-specific level. Second,  functional features of the sensors must be characterized in a similar fashion. Finally,  a link between form and function needs to be established. A description of the biodiversity in shape requires some form of registration between shapes from different species. For the outer ears of bats,  this problem has been addressed by virtue of an ad-hoc method that represents the ears in cylindrical coordinates with a reference frame that is fixed through a potential field in analogy to the interactions between molecules. An alternative method that is likely to generalize to more difficult geometries such as the noseleaves of bats can be based on modal analysis.

For the acoustic function of diffracting baffles local features such as grooves and ridges can be of prime importance.

There have been a variety of local shape descriptors developed for these tasks,  which have been evaluated in isolation or in pairs,  but not against each other. We provide a survey of existing descriptors and a framework for comparing them. We perform a detailed evaluation of the descriptors using real data sets from a variety of sources. We first evaluate how stable these metrics are under changes in mesh resolution,  noise,  and smoothing. We then analyze the discriminatory ability of the descriptors for the task of shape matching. Our conclusion is that sampling the normal distribution and the mean curvature,  using 25 samples,  and reducing this data to 5-10 samples via Principal Components Analysis provides robustness to noise and the best shape discrimination results.

Compared to iso-surfaces,  extremal surfaces are particularly challenging to construct in part due to the presence of boundaries and the lack of a consistent orientation. We present a novel,  grid-based algorithm for constructing polygonal approximations of extremal surfaces that may be open or unorientable. The algorithm is simple to implement and applicable to both uniform and adaptive grid structures. More importantly,  the resulting discrete surface preserves the structural property of the extremal surface in a grid-independent manner.

These models are widely used in computer graphics applications due to their implicit de?nition,  low-level volumetric representation and the powerful numerical techniques used to produce the PDE-based deformation. We present a set of interactive sketch-based level-set surface editing operators. These operators allow a user to sketch curves above or on a level-set surface in order to edit the surface?s shape. Once the curves are sketched the surface interactively evolves to locally ?t to the curves. A user may then modify the curves in order to re?ne the shape of the model. The mathematics,  algorithms and techniques needed to implement numerous sketch-based level set modeling capabilities are described.

Such algorithms allow users to construct surfaces of similar quality more ef?ciently by using a small set of oblique contours,  rather than many parallel contours. However,  current medical imaging systems do not provide tools for sketching contours on oblique planes. In this paper,  we take the ?rst steps towards bridging the gap between the new surface reconstruction technologies and putting those methods to use in practice. We develop a novel interface for modeling surfaces from volume data by allowing the user to sketch contours on arbitrarily oriented cross-sections of the volume,  and we examine the users? ability to contour the same structures using oblique cross-sections with similar consistency as they can using parallel cross-sections. We measure the inter-observer and intra-observer variability of trained physicians contouring on oblique cross-sections of real patient data as compared to the traditional parallel cross-sections,  and show that the variation is much higher for oblique contouring. We then show that this variability can be greatly reduced by integrating a collection of training images into the interface.

We use this data to reconstruct photorealistic,  3D animations of the captured expressions. The system uses a large setof sampling points on the face to accurately track the three dimensional deformations of the face. Simultaneously with the trackingof the geometric data,  we capture multiple high resolution,  registered video images of the face. These images are used to create atexture map sequence for a three dimensional polygonal face modelwhich can then be rendered on standard 3D graphics hardware. Theresulting facial animation is surprisingly life-like and looks verymuch like the original live performance. Separating the capture ofthe geometry from the texture images eliminates much of the variance in the image data due to motion,  which increases compressionratios. Although the primary emphasis of our work is not compression we have investigated the use of a novel method to compressthe geometric data based on principal components analysis.

0/2006	The Real Effect of Warm-Cool Colors on Depth Ordering	tech200718	Proceedings of the 3rd Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization	"The relationship between color and perceived depth for realistic,  colored objects with varying shading was explored. Background: Studies have shown that warm-colored stimuli tend to appear nearer in depth than cool-colored stimuli. The majority of these studies asked human observers to view physically equidistant,  colored stimuli and compare them for relative depth. However,  in most cases,  the stimuli presented were rather simple: straight colored lines,  uniform color patches,  point light sources,  or symmetrical objects with uniform shading. Additionally,  the colors were typically highly saturated. Although such stimuli are useful for isolating and studying depth cues in certain contexts,  they leave open the question of whether the human visual system operates similarly for realistic objects. Method: Participants were presented with all possible pairs from a set of differently colored objects and were asked to select the object in each pair that appears closest to them. The objects were presented on a standard computer screen,  against 4 different uniform backgrounds of varying intensity. Results: Our results show that the relative strength of color as a depth cue increases when the colored stimuli are presented against darker backgrounds and decreases when presented against lighter backgrounds. Conclusion: Color does impact our depth perception even though it is a relatively weak indicator and is not necessarily the overriding depth cue for complex,  realistic objects. Application: Our observations can be used to guide the selection of color to enhance the perceived depth of objects presented on traditional display devices and newer immersive virtual environments.

We use a novel gaze manipulation technique called Subtle Gaze Direction [Bailey et al. 2009] to guide novice users as they try to identify abnormalities in digital mammogram images. Subtle Gaze Direction is achieved by performing brief image-space modulations on specific regions of the viewer\s peripheral vision in order to attract their attention. The viewer\s gaze is monitored in real-time and the modulations are terminated before the viewer is allowed to scrutinize them with their high-acuity foveal vision. This approach is preferred to more overt techniques which require permanent alterations to the original images in order to highlight specific areas of interest. In our experiment we use Subtle Gaze Direction to guide novices along the scanpath of an expert radiologist. We hypothesized that this approach would increase the likelihood of novices correctly identifying irregularities in the mammograms. gaze manipulation,  image-space modulations,  mammography,  radiological training, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2168556.2168568	http://cindygr.github.io/files/etra2012sgm.pdf	Srinivas Sridharan and Reynold Bailey and Ann McNamara and Cindy Grimm

It is possible to influence where attention is allocated using a technique called Subtle Gaze Direction (SGD). SGD combines eye tracking with subtle image-space modulations to guide viewer gaze about a scene. Modulations are terminated before the viewer can scrutinize them with high acuity foveal vision. This approach is preferred to overt techniques that require permanent alterations to images to highlight areas of interest. In our study,  participants were asked to recall the location of objects or regions in images. We investigated if using SGD to guide attention to these regions would improve recall. Results showed that the influence of SGD significantly improved accuracy of target count and spatial location recall. This has implications for a wide range of applications including spatial learning in virtual environments as well as image search applications,  virtual training and perceptually based rendering. subtle gaze,  information recall,  eye-tracking,  gaze direction,  short-term memory, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2168567, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2168556.2168567	http://cindygr.github.io/files/etra2012isg.pdf	Reynold Bailey and Aaron Costello and Ann McNamara and Srinivas Sridharan and Cindy Grimm

The user can sketch in a free-form manner from any view at any time,  and the system infers how those sketch strokes should be added to the drawing. Specifically,  existing curves are projected to 2D and analyzed to see if the stroke edits or extends an existing curve,  or if the stroke should make a new curve. In the former case the 2D stroke is promoted to 3D using the position of the existing curve,  and then joined to that curve. In the latter case,  we use additional spatial information (e.g. temporary 3D surfaces) to create a new curve in 3D. All non-sketching interactions are based on unintrusive context-aware,  in-screen pie menus designed for rapid pen-based input. We also provide novel rendering styles and aides for interpreting and working with 3D sketches.

8/2012	Directing Gaze in Narrative Art	apgv2012dg	Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception	"Narrative art tells a story,  either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. In many works of art separate panels within the same frame are used to depict the sequence of events. Often,  there is no clear delineation between these panels,  or any indication of the optimal viewing order. To improve visual literacy we propose using Subtle Gaze Direction (SGD) to direct the viewers gaze across an image in a manner which reveals the story. SGD uses small image space modulations in the luminance channel to guide a viewer\s gaze about an image without disrupting their normal visual experience. Using a simple ordering task we compared performance using no modulation and using subtle modulation with the correct order of narrative episodes as intended by the artist. Results from experiments show improved performance when SGD is employed. This experiment establishes the potential of the method as an aid to visual navigation in images where the viewing order is unclear. art history education,  eye-tracking,  gaze direction, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2338676.2338689	http://cindygr.github.io/files/apgv2012dg.pdf	Ann McNamara and Stephen Caffey and Thomas Booth and Cindy Grimm and  Srinivas Sridharan and Reynold Bailey	
7/2013	Surface Patches for 3D Sketching	sbim2013sp	Proceedings of the International Symposium on Sketch-Based Interfaces and Modeling	"3D sketching is an appealing approach for creating concept shapes in the early stages of design. While curve networks alone can convey shape,  surfacing the network can dramatically help with visualization and interaction. Unfortunately,  surfacing a curve network is an inherently ambiguous problem,  and even if the correct surface patches are identified,  they can have an arbitrarily complex 3D geometry,  making it challenging to produce a reasonable tessellation. In this paper we address the problem of creating light-weight surface tessellations on the fly. Our approach is to identify potential patches in the curve network,  and then break complicated patches into simpler ones which can be tessellated using any simple algorithm. Our surfacing approach relies on the observation that breaking a complicated patch into a set of nearly planar ones with small total area seems to create a simple,  natural-looking surfaces. We demonstrate our approach on curve networks generated by two different 3D sketching systems. curve-based modeling,  sketching 3D curves,  surface patches, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2487381.2487387	http://cindygr.github.io/files/sbim2013sp.pdf	Fatemeh Abbasinejad and Pushkar Joshi and Cindy Grimm and Nina Amenta

In this work we extend the concept of gaze manipulation beyond digital imagery to include controlled,  real-world environments. We address two main challenges in guiding attention to real-world objects: determining what object the viewer is currently paying attention to,  and providing (projecting) a visual cue on a different part of the scene in order to draw the viewer\s attention there. Our system consists of a pair of eye-tracking glasses to determine the viewer\s gaze location,  and a projector to create the visual cue in the physical environment.

This paper presents a novel interface for using image-space con- straints to control camera interpolation in animation sequences. Traditional camera control can be challenging because the user must envision how the camera should be positioned in order to place the objects on the image plane the way they want. While it is fairly simple to place an object in the center of the scene and rotate the camera around it,  more complex camera motions that involve both view direction change and motion of the object across the screen can be very difficult to envision and implement with smooth motion. In contrast,  we provide a simple interface that allows the user to directly draw out the trajectory,  size,  and orientation of an object on the screen,  while the system automatically solves for a sequence of cameras that satisfies those constraints. Unlike previous image- space constraint approaches,  we use a constraint vocabulary which is both easy to use and produces more stable solutions.

Traditional telepresence systems allow remote users to passively observe,  forcing them to look at whatever the camera is pointing at. If we want something to remain private,  then we simply do not put it in front of the camera. Remote presence systems,  on the other hand,  allow active observation,  and put the control of the camera in the hands of the remote operator. They can drive around,  and look at the world from different viewpoints,  which complicates privacy protection.In this paper,  we look at how we can establish privacy protections for remote presence systems by manipulating the video data sent back to them.

Producing accurate segmentations often proves to be both inefficient and challenging,  in part due to lack of imaging data quality (contrast and resolution),  and because of ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure and the context wherein it resides. Automatic and semi-automatic approaches are improving,  but in many cases still fail or require substantial manual clean-up or intervention. Expert manual segmentation and review is therefore still the gold standard for many applications. Unfortunately,  existing tools (both custom-made and commercial) are often designed based on the underlying algorithm,  not the best method for expressing higher-level intention. Our goal is to analyze manual (or semi-automatic) segmentation to gain a better understanding of both low-level (perceptual tasks and actions) and high-level decision making. This can be used to produce segmentation tools that are more accurate,  efficient,  and easier to use.

10/2016	A Method for Establishing Correspondences Between Hand-Drawn and Sensor-Generated Maps	icsr2016maps	International Conference on Social Robotics	"Maps,  and specifically floor plans,  are useful for planning a variety of tasks from arranging furniture to designating conceptual or functional spaces (e.g.  kitchen,  walkway). However,  maps generated directly from robot sensor data can be hard to interpret and use for this purpose,  especially for individuals who are not used to them,  because of sensor and odometry measurement errors and the probabilistic nature of the mapping algorithms themselves. In this paper,  we present an algorithm for quickly laying a floor plan (or other conceptual map) onto a map generated from sensor data,  creating a one-to-one mapping between the two This allows humans interacting with the robot to use a more readily-understandable representation of the world,  while the robot itself uses the sensor-generated map.We look at two use cases: specifying “no-go” regions within a room,  and visually locating objects within a room. Although a user study showed no statistical difference between the two types of maps in terms of performance on this spatial memory task,  we argue that floor plans are closer to the mental maps people naturally draw to characterize spaces,  and are easier to use for untrained individuals.

11/2016	Human-Planned Robotic Grasp Ranges: Capture and Validation	AAAI2016hp	AAAI Fall Symposium Series	"Leveraging human grasping skills to teach a robot to perform a manipulation task is appealing,  but there are several limitations to this approach: time-inefficient data capture procedures,  limited generalization of the data to other grasps and objects,  and inability to use that data to learn more about how humans perform and evaluate grasps. This paper presents a data capture protocol that partially addresses these deficiencies by asking participants to specify ranges over which a grasp is valid. The protocol is verified both qualitatively through online survey questions (where within-range grasps are identified correctly with the nearest extreme grasp) and quantitatively by showing that there is small variation in grasps ranges from different participants as measured by joint angles and position. We demonstrate that these grasp ranges are valid through testing on a physical robot (93.75% of grasps interpolated from grasp ranges are successful). grasping,  learning from demonstration,  grasp range, "	https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS16/paper/view/14106		Brendan John and Jackson Carter and Javier Ruiz and Sai Krishna Allani and Saurabh Dixit and Cindy Grimm and Ravi Balasubramanian

Judgments about privacy would seem to be context-dependent,  but none of the promising work on contextual \""frames\"" has focused on privacy concerns. This work studies the impact of contextual \""frames\"" on local users\ privacy judgments in a home telepresence setting. Our methodology consists of using an online questionnaire to collect responses to animated videos of a telepresence robot after framing people with an introductory paragraph. The results of four studies indicate a large effect of manipulating the robot operator\s identity between a stranger and a close confidante. It also appears that this framing effect persists throughout several videos. These findings serve to caution HRI researchers that a change in frame could cause their results to fail to replicate or generalize. We also recommend that robots be designed to encourage or discourage certain frames. privacy,  robotics, "	https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3020218		Matthew Rueben and Frank Bernieri and Cindy Grimm and William Smart

Similar to other shape understanding tasks --- such as paper folding --- performance on this task varies across the population,  and can be improved through training and practice. We are --- long term --- interested in creating training tools for 3D volume segmentation. To this end,  we have modified (and evaluated) an existing cross-section performance measure in the context of our intended application. Our primary adaptations were 1) to use 3D stimuli (instead of 2D) to more accurately capture the real-world application and 2) evaluate performance on 3D biological shapes relative to the 3D geometric shapes used in the previous study. Our findings are: 1) Participants had the same pattern of errors as the original study,  but overall their performance improved when they could see the objects rotating in 3D. 2) Inferring cross-sections of biological shapes is more challenging than pure geometric shapes. 3D volume segmentation,  cross-sections,  spatial ability test, "	http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3119881.3119888		Anahita Sanandaji and Cindy Grimm and Ruth West

Survey questions are based on an adopted taxonomy that combines grasp pre-shape,  approach,  wrist orientation,  object shape,  orientation and size which covers a large swathe of common grasps. For example,  the survey identifies at what object height or width dimension (normalized by robot hand size) the human prefers to use a two finger precision grasp versus a three-finger power grasp. This information is represented as a confidence-interval based polytope in the object shape space. The result is a database that can be used to quickly find potential pre-grasps that are likely to work,  given an estimate of the object shape and size. grasp type,  human study, "	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8460860		Ammar Kothari and John Morrow and Victoria Thrasher and Kadon Engle and Ravi Balasubramanian and Cindy Grimm

Specifically,  we use this approach to analyze three different types of hands (one underactuated,  one fully actuated,  one fully actuated with compliant distal joints) as they are used to perform two manipulation tasks. The first task uses a power grasp (spraying with a spray bottle),  the second a precision grasp (tracing a line on a bowl with a pen). We show that compliance in the distal joints significantly improves performance and task completion. We also show that humans choose significantly different poses for the same task when using a fully-actuated versus underactuated hand,  which also results in superior task performance. Our results suggest that humans use a combination of under-actuated and fully-actuated techniques,  which when used on robotic systems would also improve their performance on manipulation tasks. underactuated hands,  human studies, "	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594344		John Morrow and Ammar Kothari and Yi Herng Ong and Nathan Harlan and Ravi Balasubramanian and Cindy Grimm

6/2018	Dataset for Near Contact Grasping Trajectories	rss2018dnc	"Robotics: Science and Systems,  New Benchmarks Metrics  and Competitions for Robot Learning Workshop"	"To date the design of grasping metrics has largelyfocused on finding (and calculating) specific features that are(potentially) relevant to grouping or characterizing grasps,  andparticularly on metrics that might predict success (or failure) ofa grasp. These metrics leverage human knowledge of physicalinteraction and are typically relatively quick to compute. Onedrawback to them,  however,  is that they are heterogeneous (eg, some combination of number of contact points,  force vectors, positional or joint data),  often specific to the robotic handemployed (eg,  joint angles) and rarely take the full object shapeinto account (often reducing the shape geometry via PCA toa simple 3-vector). From a machine-learning perspective thismakes it challenging to combine and learn over mixed datasets. A more subtle challenge is that the metrics (particularlycontact points) are unstable,  in that very small movements ofthe geometry can result in big changes in the number andlocation of contacts.In this paper we explore an alternative metric which ishand and object agnostic,  and very stable with respect to smallchanges in the geometry of the hand or object. Although computationally more expensive than existing,  specialized approaches(and also higher dimensional),  we propose that it may be moresuited to machine learning analysis. At heart,  this metric simplycaptures the ways in which the object is free to “twist” or moveout of the hand, grasping metric, "	https:/atanaso.github.io/rcw-icra18/assets/ref/ICRA-MRP18_paper_10.pdf		Ammar Kothari and Yi Ong and John Morrow and Ravi Balasubramanian and Cindy Grimm
