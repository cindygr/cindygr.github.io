5/2003	A Thesis on a 3D Input Device for Sketching Characters	tech200320	Washington University in St. Louis	"Tracking a piece of paper as a drawing surface., The goal of this project is to develop a 3D input device using a stiff piece ofpaper and a camera. The camera tracks the piece of paper in 3D space. The userorients the paper in 3D space and then draws on the paper using a pen-like device. The camera tracks the movement of the pen on the piece of paper. The location of the pen in 3D space can then be calculated from the orientation of the paper.A drawing application that uses this 3D input device was also developed. Theapplication allows a user to make characters by sketching ellipses. The drawing application creates a virtual rendering of the paper and displays this to the user. As the user positions the real paper,  the virtual one mirrors its movements. The user can draw shapes on the paper. These shapes then get rendered in the virtual scene., Tracking,  3D drawing , https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/1068/, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Mark Schroering

Published in <a href=\""http://grapp.visigrapp.org/GRAPP2007/\"">GRAPP</a>, 2007, This work presents a novel rendering technique inspired by artistic approaches.Instead of trying to recreate the appearance of a traditional medium,  such as charcoal or watercolor,  this approach is a mixture of both photo-realism and abstraction.Artists use a process of abstraction to provide structural information about subjects that do not have clearly defined shapes,  such as groups of leaves in a tree. For example,  an artist will first use a color wash to approximate a group of leaves,  then add detail on top of parts of this wash to indicate individual leaves. Similarly,  weuse an abstract shape that approximates the image of leaves clustered at the end of a branch. To prevent oversimplification,  we add photo-realistic detail using a blendingprocess. Inter-frame coherence is achieved by smoothly interpolating the abstract shapes as well as by the continuity inherent in the photo-realistically rendered detail., Non-photorealistic rendering,  abstraction"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Nathan Dudley

Published in Pacific Graphics, 2003, The goal of this research is to explore techniques for shading 3D computer generated models using scanned images of actual paint samples. The techniques presented emphasize artistic control of brush stroke texture and color. We first demonstrate how the texture of a paint sample can be separated from its color transition. Four methods,  three real-time and one off-line,  for producing rendered images from the paint samples are then presented.

1/2006	A View-Based Deformation Tool-kit	tech2006	Washington Universtiy in St. Louis	"CubeCam for single camera control and a framework for non-linear projection. CubeCam was published in Computational Aesthetics, 2009,  the curved perspective in Eurographics short papers 2005,  and the non-linear perspective rendering in NPAR 2008., Camera manipulation is a hard problem since a graphics camera is defined by specifying 11 independent parameters. Manipulating such a high-dimensional space to accomplish specific tasks is difficult and requires a certain amount of expertise. We present an intuitive interface that allows novice users to perform camera operations in terms of the change they want see in the image. In addition to developing a naturalmeans for camera interaction,  our system also includes a novel interface for viewing and organizing previously saved views. When exploring complex 3D data-sets a single view is not sufficient. Instead,  a composite view built from multiple views may be more useful. While changing a single camera is hard enough,  manipulating several cameras in a single scene is still harder. In this thesis,  we also present a framework for creating composite views and an interface that allows users to manipulate such views in real-time., Camera control and non-linear perspective, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/196/, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Nisha Sudarsanam

6/2017	Gender Differences in Robot Teleoperation	thesis2017Dilruba	Oregon State University	"Published as a paper in Ubiquitous Robots 2018, Gender issues have recently received increased attention in human robot interaction(HRI). Because robots are becoming part of our homes and daily lives,  it isimportant to understand how di erent groups of people use them. To the bestof our knowledge,  almost no research has been done that investigates gender differencesin users information need,  information processing strategy,  self-e cacy, tinkering and their impact in human robot interaction. This thesis investigatesthese four aspects by examining object manipulation task from gender perspectiveusing a humanoid robot (PR2). We used both qualitative and quantitative approachesfor cross validation and methodological triangulation. Our experimentalresults show that females asked for more information before using the robot thanmales (p = 0.0002). Females processed information comprehensively and malesprocessed information selectively (p < 0.001) for using the robot. Males showedgreater self-e cacy than females (p = 0.0002). Males tinkered more with the robotthan females (p = 0.0021). We found that tinkering was positively correlated (p= 0.0068) with task success and negatively correlated (p = 0.0032) with taskcompletion time. Tinkering perhaps led to males greater task success and lowertask completion time with the robot.

8/2016	Analyzing Human Gaze Patterns During Grasping Tasks To Advance Robotic Grasping	thesis2016Sai	Oregon State University	"Published in Symposium on Applied Perception 2018, There is a strong interest in the robotics community in learning how humans grasp and manipulate objects,  partly because robots need to operate in human environments and partly because humans are currently much better in physical interaction tasks than robots. This thesis seeks to identify the human heuristics for grasping by analyzing human gaze patterns when humans perform grasping tasks using their own hand and when they use a robotic hand. This thesis uses a human-subject experiment to analyze the participant\s eye-gaze for finding what features people think are important for grasping objects. The features included where the fingertips settle down on the object relative to the object’s edges,  center of mass,  etc. It was found that while gaze patterns on the objects are similar whether the human used the robot hand or the human hand,  participants spent substantially more time gazing at the robotic hand then their own,  particularly the wrist and finger positions. In a subsequent study,  it was also shown that choosing camera angles that clearly display the features participants are interested in enables the participants to more effectively determine the effectiveness of a grasp from images. This thesis’s findings are relevant both for robotic grasp planning algorithms (where visual cues are important for analyzing objects for potential grasps) and for designing tele-operation interfaces (how best to present the visual data to the remote operator)., https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/k930c277f, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Sai Krishna Allani

It specifically focuses on identification of human heuristics of grasp similarity by extensive human-subject experiments. This heuristic is then utilized to develop a robust metric for identifying similar robotic grasps. The central hypothesis of this work is to speed up grasp planning and improve the reliability of the planned grasps by using the human heuristic for grasp similarity. Experimental results show that (i) new similar grasps generated from interpolation of human-provided grasps have similar performance (93.75% success rate) compared to original human grasps (97% success rate) and (ii) grasps with similar hand configurations are functionally similar when applied to large regions of everyday objects,  but functionally similar grasp does not necessarily dictate similar hand configuration., Published in AAAI Fall Symposium 2016, https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/37720j09c, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Saurabh Milind Dixit	
3/2017	Modeling a Spectrum of 3D Printed Materials for Soft Robots	thesis2017Samantha	Oregon State University	"Soft robotics is an emerging field that heavily relies on the ability of 3D printers. The limitations in soft robotics lie in the area of the 3D printers and the predictive models of the printed materials. There are currently no reliable models for optimizing the gradients required to create soft robots. These gradients are necessary to go from soft to hard materials which are used in electronics and soft robotics grips. This is achievable with the soft materials printed by the Stratasys Objet 500 Connex3,  which can print a gradient in materials from hard to soft. Here we show the ability to print a homogeneous gradient on the printer,  characterize these homogeneous materials,  and model the optimized parameters of the nonlinear elastic material model according to techniques based upon Ogden., https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/s4655k29q, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Samantha Hemleben	
8/2007	Perception Guided Image Manipulation	phd2007rb	Washington University in St. Louis	"Published in APGV (study on depth ordering),  TAP and TOG (subtle gaze direction),  and the Visual Computer (motion and depth ordering of content in images), This dissertation presents a novel approach to image editing and manipulation where the goal is to explicitly trigger certain visual cues. We refer to this as perceptually meaningful image manipulation. Existing image editing approaches typically do not take human visual perception into account,  whereas our approach relies heavily on the principles of human visual perception. We present computer-based techniques for simulating artistic control of apparent depth in an image,  conveying a sense of motion in an image,  and subtly directing a viewer\s gaze about an image. Our techniques combine elements of traditional art with research from various fields of science. Our image-based technique for simulating artistic control of apparent depth works by automatically adjusting color or luminance in specific regions of an image. The color and luminance adjustment is based on several simple rules that artists use to convey and manipulate apparent depth in their work. Our technique for conveying a sense of motion in  a visually static image introduces spatial imprecision in the image plane. This is also patterned after work done by traditional artists. It has been suggested that spatially imprecise stimuli are processed differently by our foveal vision and our peripheral vision  and that this difference in visual processing causes the image to appear to have a dynamic component. Finally,  our subtle gaze directing technique exploits differences in visual acuity  and processing speed between our foveal and peripheral vision. We present brief,  subtle image-space modulations to the low acuity peripheral regions of the ?eld of view. These stimuli,  which are detected quickly,  attract the slower,  high acuity foveal vision to fixate on the modulated regions. "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Reynold Bailey	
12/2006	Comparing Features of Three-Dimensional Object Models using Registration based on Surface Curvature Signatures	phd2007tg	Washington University in St. Louis	"Published in Geometric Modeling and processing,  2006 (feature detection),  International Journal of Shape Modeling,  2006 (comparison of curvature techniques),  and Shape Modeling International,  2005 (comparing local shape using curvature). Source code for curvature techniques is available at <a href=\""http://sourceforge.net/projects/meshprocessing/\"">Sourceforge</a>, This dissertation presents a technique for comparing local shape properties for similar  three-dimensional objects represented by meshes. We develop a shape representation that is sensitive to subtle shape differences but relatively insensitive to noise,  and  use this representation to detect features of the objects. The features are used,  along  with a measure for shape similarity,  to compute a correspondence between the objects,  which then allows shape comparison based on the shape properties at corresponding points. An advantage of this approach is that the final comparisons depend on the similarity-based correspondence and not on a physical three-dimensional alignment. <p>Our novel shape representation,  the curvature map"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Timothy David Gatzke	
8/2012	Modeling Surfaces from Volume Data Using Nonparallel Contours	phd2012ross	Washington University in St. Louis	"Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI) and computed tomography: CT) scanners have long been used to produce three-dimensional samplings of anatomy elements for use in medical visualization and analysis. From such datasets,  physicians often need to construct surfaces representing anatomical shapes in order to conduct treatment,  such as irradiating a tumor. Traditionally,  this is done through a time-consuming and error-prone process in which an experienced scientist or physician marks a series of parallel contours that outline the structures of interest. Recent advances in surface reconstruction algorithms have led to methods for reconstructing surfaces from nonparallel contours that could greatly reduce the manual component of this process. Despite these technological advances,  the segmentation process has remained unchanged.This dissertation takes the first steps toward bridging the gap between the new surface reconstruction technologies and bringing those methods to use in clinical practice. We develop VolumeViewer,  a novel interface for modeling surfaces from volume data by allowing the user to sketch contours on arbitrarily oriented cross-sections of the volume. We design the algorithms necessary to support nonparallel contouring,  and we evaluate the system with medical professionals using actual patient data. In this way,  we begin to understand how nonparallel contouring can aid the segmentation process and expose the challenges associated with a nonparallel contouring system in practice., https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/etd/981/, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Ross Sowell	
8/2013	Shape Correspondence for Biological Applications	phd2013Ly	Washington University in St. Louis	"With the tremendous amount of data generated by the latest imaging technologies,  research efforts have shifted focus from rendering and reconstructing shapes from raw image data,  to analyzing these shapes. This is especially true in biomedical applications with widespread availability of many non-invasive biological imaging modalities -- ultrasonography,  computed tomography,  magnetic resonance imaging,  etcetera. The insights gained from the analysis of biomedical images can help us understand biological processes,  diagnose diseases and take preventative or remedial action. Examples include the study of an organ that is normally in cyclical motion,  or that of an organ undergoing transformation in the course of normal development,  or deterioration as a result of disease.Many biological studies depend on a reliable means to compare different images or shapes of a similar nature,  and quantify changes in them. A key component in these studies is the accuracy and reliability of the correspondence between shapes. This task is often complicated by the lack of easily identifiable features underpinning the correspondence,  in addition to the inherent difficulties of obtaining high resolution"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Ly Phan	
12/2016	Guided Medical Data Segmentation Using Structure-Aligned Planar Contours	phd2016Michelle	Washington University in St. Louis	"Segmentation of 3D/4D biological images is a critical step for a wide range of applications such as treatment planning,  quantitative analysis,  virtual simulations,  and rendering visualizations. Automatic segmentation methods are becoming more reliable,  but many experts still rely on manual intervention which makes segmentation a time and resource intensive bottleneck. Marking boundary contours in 3D images can be difficult when images are often noisy or the delineation of biological tissue is unclear. Non-parallel contours can be more accurate and reduce the amount of marking necessary,  but require extra effort to ensure boundary consistency and maintain spatial orientation. This dissertation focuses three problems that pertain to drawing non-parallel contour networks and generating a segmentation surface from those networks.First a guided structure-aligned segmentation system is detailed that utilizes prior structure knowledge from past segmentations of similar data. It employs a contouring protocol to aid in navigating the volume data and support using arbitrarily-oriented contouring planes placed to capture or follow the global structure shape. A user study is provided to test how well novices perform segmentation using this system. The following two problems then aim to improve different aspects of this system. A new deformation approach to reconstruction is discussed which deforms previous segmentation meshes to fit protocol drawn contours from new data instances in order to obtain accurate segmentations that have the correct topology and general shape and preserves fine details. The focus is on the problem of finding a correspondence between a mesh and a set of contours describing a similar shape. And finally,  a new robust algorithm that resolves inconsistencies in contour networks is detailed. Inconsistent contours are faster and less demanding to draw,  and they allow the segmenter to focus on drawing boundaries and not maintaining consistency. However,  inconsistency is detrimental to most reconstruction algorithms,  so the network must be fixed as a post process after drawing., "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Michelle Vaughan Holloway	
6/2018	Developing a 2D Cross-section Training Strategy for 3D Volume Segmentation by Analyzing Human Perception and Cognitive Tasks	phd2018Anahita	Oregon State University	"3D volume segmentation is a fundamental process in many scientific and medical applications. Producing accurate segmentations,  in an efficient way,  is challenging,  in part due to low imaging data quality (e.g.,  noise and low image resolution),  and ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure. Automatic algorithms do exist,  but there are many use cases where they fail. The gold standard is still manual segmentation or review. Unfortunately,  even for an expert,  manual segmentation is laborious,  time consuming,  and prone to errors. Existing 3D segmentation tools are often designed based on the underlying algorithm"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Anahita Sanandaji

12/2005	Interactive Manipulation of 3D Scene Projections	tech200513	Washington University in St. Louis	"Published in  Graphite 2005 as 3D Screen Space Widgets, Linear perspective is a good approximation to the format in which the human visual system conveys 3D scene information to the brain. Artists expressing 3D scenes,  however,  create nonlinear projections that balance their linear perspective view of a scene with elements of aesthetic style,  layout and relative importance of scene objects. Manipulating the many parameters of a linear perspective camera to achieve a desired view is not easy. Controlling and combining multiple such cameras to specify a nonlinear projection is an even more cumbersome task. This paper presents a direct interface,  where an artist manipulates in 2D the desired projection of a few features of the 3D scene. The features represent a rich set of constraints which define the overall projection of the 3D scene. Desirable properties of local linear perspective and global scene coherence drive a heuristic algorithm that attempts to interactively satisfy the sketched constraints as a weight-averaged projection of a minimal set of linear perspective cameras. This paper shows that 2D feature constraints are a direct and effective approach to control both the 2D layout of scene objects and the conceptually complex,  high dimensional parameter space of nonlinear scene projection. The simplicity of our interface also makes it an appealing alternative to standard through-the-lens and widget based techniques to control a single linear perspective camera., Non-linear projection,  image-space camera control, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/930/, "		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Patrick Coleman and Leon Barrett and Cindy Grimm and Karan Singh

5/2006	Smooth Key-framing using the Image Plane	tech200628	Washington University in St. Louis	"Published in Graphite, 2005, This paper demonstrates the use of image-space constraints for key frame interpolation. Interpolating in image-space results in sequences with predictable and controlable image trajectories and projected size for selected objects,  particularly in cases where the desired center of rotation isnot fixed or when the key frames contain perspective distortion changes. Additionally,  we provide the user with direct image-space control over how the key frames are interpolated by allowingthem to directly edit the object’s projected size and trajectory.Image-space key frame interpolation requires solving the inverse camera problem over a sequence of point constraints. This is a variation of the standard camera pose problem,  with theadditional constraint that the sequence be visually smooth. We use image-space camera interpolation to globally control the projection,  and traditional camera interpolation locally to avoid smoothness problems. We compare and contrast three different constraint-solving systems in terms of accuracy,  speed,  and stability. The first approach was originally developed to solve thisproblem [Gleicher and Witken 1992]; we extend it to include internal camera parameter changes.The second approach uses a standard single-frame solver. The third approach is based on a novel camera formulation and we show that it is particularly suited to solving this problem., Camera interpolation,  image-space constraints,  key-framing"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Leon Barrett and Cindy Grimm	
5/2006	Feature Detection using Curvature Maps and the Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithm	tech200622	Washington University in St. Louis	"A longer version of the <a href=\""./papers/gmp2006fd/gmp2006fd.pdf\"">short paper</a>  in <a href=\""https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540367116\""> GMP 2006</a>., Automatic detection of features in three-dimensional objects is a criticalpart of shape matching tasks such as object registration and recognition. Previousapproaches to local surface matching have either focused on man-made objects, where features are generally well-defined,  or required some type of userinteraction to select features. Manual selection of corresponding features andsubjective determination of the difference between objects are time consumingprocesses requiring a high level of expertise. Curvature is a useful property of asurface,  but curvature calculation on a discrete mesh is often noisy and not alwaysaccurate. However,  the Curvature Map,  which represents shape information for apoint and its surrounding region,  is robust with respect to grid resolution and meshregularity. It can be used as a measure of local surface similarity. We use thesecurvature map properties to extract features and segment the surface accordingly.Although thresholding techniques can be used to generate reasonable features,  thechoice of a threshold is very subjective and the results may be very sensitive tothis choice. To avoid the threshold dilemma and to make the selection of the featureregion less subjective,  we employ a min-cut/max-flow graph cut algorithm, with vertex weights derived from the curvature map property. A multi-scale approachis used to minimize the dependence on user defined parameters. We showthat by combining curvature maps and graph cuts in a multi-scale framework,  wecan extract meaningful features in a robust way."		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Timothy Gatzke and Cindy Grimm

The vast majority of thesestudies have asked human observers to view physically equidistant, colored stimuli and compare them for relative depth. However,  inmost cases,  the stimuli presented were rather simple: straight coloredlines,  uniform color patches,  point light sources,  or symmetricalobjects with uniform shading. Additionally,  the colors usedwere typically highly saturated. Although such stimuli are usefulin isolating and studying depth cues in certain contexts,  theyleave open the question of whether the human visual system operatessimilarly for realistic objects.

The user loads an image,  selects an object and specifies whether theobject should appear closer or further away. The system automatically determines target values for the objectand/or background that achieve the desired depth change. These depth editing operations,  based on techniquesused by traditional artists,  manipulate either the luminance or color temperature of different regions of the image.By performing blending in the gradient domain and reconstruction with a Poisson solver,  the appearance offalse edges is minimized. The results of a preliminary user study,  designed to evaluate the effectiveness of thesetechniques,  are also presented., Image processing,  depth editing,  contrast"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Reynold Bailey and Cindy Grimm

Panoramic imaging systems using charge-coupled device CCD cameras as the photodetector have been developed to overcome the inability to monitor electrical activity from the entire cardiac surface. Photodiode arrays PDAs are known to have higher temporal resolution and signal quality,  but lower spatial resolution compared to CCD cameras. We construct a panoramic imaging system with three PDAs and image Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts n=18 during normal sinus rhythm,  epicardial pacing,  and arrhythmias. The recorded spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical activity is texture mapped onto a reconstructed 3-D geometrical heart model specific to each heart studied. The PDA-based system provides sufficient spatial resolution 1.72 mm without interpolation  for the study of wavefront propagation in the rabbit heart.

4/2009	VolumeViewer: An Interactive Tool for Fitting Surfaces to Volume Data	tech200913	Washington University in St. Louis	"Presented at <a href=\""http://sbim09.cse.wustl.edu/\"">Sketch-based Interfaces and Modeling,  2009</a>, Recent advances in surface reconstruction algorithms allow surfaces to be built from contours lying on non-parallel planes. Such algorithms allow users to construct surfaces of similar quality more efficiently by using a small set of oblique contours,  rather than many parallel contours. However,  current medical imaging systems do not provide tools for sketching contours on oblique planes. In this paper,  we take the first steps towards bridging the gap between the new surface reconstruction technologies and putting those methods to use in practice. We develop a novel interface for modeling surfaces from volume data by allowing the user to sketch contours on arbitrarily oriented cross-sections of the volume,  and we examine the users\ ability to contour the same structures using oblique cross-sections with similar consistency as they can using parallel cross-sections. We measure the inter-observer and intra-observer variability of trained physicians contouring on oblique cross-sections of real patient data as compared to the traditional parallel cross-sections,  and show that the variation is much higher for oblique contouring. We then show that this variability can be greatly reduced by integrating a collection of training images into the interface., User interface,  manual segmentation,  oblique contouring, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/3/"		http://cindygr.github.io/files/.pdf	Ross Sowell and Lu Liu and Tao Ju and Cindy Grimm and Christopher Abraham and Garima Gokhroo and Daniel Low

The local neighborhood supports both local shape classification and robust normal estimation. In particular,  local neighborhoods out-perform traditional approaches in unevenly sampled,  curved regions.

3/2016	A Geodesics-based Surface Parameterization to Assess Aneurysm Progression	tech2016geo	Arxive	"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) intervention and surveillance is currently based on maximum transverse diameter,  even though it is recognized that this might not be the best strategy. About 10% of patients with small AAA transverse diameters,  for whom intervention is not considered,  still rupture; while patients with large AAA transverse diameters,  for whom intervention would have been recommended,  have stable aneurysms that do not rupture. While maximum transverse diameter is easy to measure and track in clinical practice,  one of its main drawbacks is that it does not represent the whole AAA and rupture seldom occurs in the region of maximum transverse diameter. By following maximum transverse diameter alone clinicians are missing information on the shape change dynamics of the AAA,  and clues that could lead to better patient care. We propose here a method to register AAA surfaces that were obtained from the same patient at different time points. Our registration method could be used to track the local changes of the patient-specific AAA. To achieve registration,  our procedure uses a consistent parameterization of the AAA surfaces followed by strain relaxation. The main assumption of our procedure is that growth of the AAA occurs in such a way that surface strains are smoothly distributed,  while regions of small and large surface growth can be differentiated. The proposed methodology has the potential to unravel different patterns of AAA growth that could be used to stratify patient risks., "			Ly Phan and Katherine Courchaine and Amir Azarbal and David Vorp and Cindy Grimm and Sandra Rugonyi

8/2016	Human-Planned Robotic Grasp Ranges: Capture and Validation	tech2016RG	Arxive	"A longer version of the AAAI Fall Symposium paper, Leveraging human grasping skills to teach a robot to perform a manipulation task is appealing,  but there are several limitations to this approach: time-inefficient data capture procedures,  limited generalization of the data to other grasps and objects,  and inability to use that data to learn more about how humans perform and evaluate grasps. This paper presents a data capture protocol that partially addresses these deficiencies by asking participants to specify ranges over which a grasp is valid. The protocol is verified both qualitatively through online survey questions (where 95.38% of within-range grasps are identified correctly with the nearest extreme grasp) and quantitatively by showing that there is small variation in grasps ranges from different participants as measured by joint angles,  contact points,  and position. We demonstrate that these grasp ranges are valid through testing on a physical robot (93.75% of grasps interpolated from grasp ranges are successful)., Grasping,  human studies, https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03366, "			Brendon John and Jackson Carter and Javier Ruiz and Sai Krishna Allani and Saurabh Dixit and Cindy M.

We present a simple algorithm for quickly laying a floor plan (or other conceptual map) onto a SLAM map,  creating a one-to-one mapping between them. Our goal was to enable using a floor plan (or other hand-drawn or annotated map) in robotic applications instead of the typical SLAM map created by the robot. We look at two use cases,  specifying \""no-go\"" regions within a room and locating objects within a scanned room. Although a user study showed no statistical difference between the two types of maps in terms of performance on this spatial memory task,  we argue that floor plans are closer to the mental maps people would naturally draw to characterize spaces., SLAM maps,  sketching, https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04836, "			Leo Bowen-Biggs and Suzanne Dazo and Yili Zhang and Alex Hubers and Matthew Rueben and Ross Sowell and William D.

9/2015	Visualization techniques for the developing chicken heart	tech2015Viz	Arxive	"Longer version of a conference paper published in 11th International Symposium on Visual Computing , We present a geometric surface parameterization algorithm and several visualization techniques adapted to the problem of understanding the 4D peristaltic-like motion of the outflow tract (OFT) in an embryonic chick heart. We illustrated the techniques using data from hearts under normal conditions (four embryos),  and hearts in which blood flow conditions are altered through OFT banding (four embryos). The overall goal is to create quantitative measures of the temporal heart-shape change both within a single subject and between multiple subjects. These measures will help elucidate how altering hemodynamic conditions changes the shape and motion of the OFT walls,  which in turn influence the stresses and strains on the developing heart,  causing it to develop differently. We take advantage of the tubular shape and periodic motion of the OFT to produce successively lower dimensional visualizations of the cardiac motion (e.g. curvature,  volume,  and cross-section) over time,  and quantifications of such visualizations., https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08834, "			Ly Phan and Sandra Rugonyi and Cindy Grimm

We aim to preserve some of that privacy by manipulating the video data that the remote user sees. Through two user studies,  we explore the effectiveness of different video manipulation techniques at providing different types of privacy. We simultaneously examine task performance in the presence of privacy protection. In the first study,  participants were asked to watch a video captured by a robot exploring an office environment and to complete a series of observational tasks under differing video manipulation conditions. Our results show that using manipulations of the video stream can lead to fewer privacy violations for different privacy types.
