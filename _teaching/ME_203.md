This is a second year course in programming designed for Mechanical Engineers. The focus is on learning to use libraries like numpy and scipy for tasks such as data processing and simulation.

The weekly format of the course is tutorials (explain the basic concepts), practice, lecture activity (actually solve a problem), then a lab. The homeworks build on the labs, and take 2-3 weeks.

Code is primarily in Jupyter Notebooks, using <a href="https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Otter Grader</a> to provide in-line feedback (and autograding in Gradescope).
