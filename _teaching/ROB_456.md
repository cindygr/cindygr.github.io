This is an introductory robotics course that builds up all the pieces needed to do SLAM.

I have taught this class approximately once a year since 2019.  

Lecture material
======
All lectures can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DKL--clpDazdIgPzSgZ6Kv4Xxx72pEVP?usp=sharing">here</a>. They are largely based off of Sebastian Thrun's "Probablistic Robotics" <a href="https://gaoyichao.com/Xiaotu/resource/refs/PR.MIT.en.pdf">book</a>.


Source code

There are four stand-alone assignments that implement the "robot hallway" example with a Bayes', Kalman, and Particle filter.

Additionally, there is a shell ROS 1 assignment for exploring an environment with a turtle bot.

To support development of the basic path planning there is a jupyter notebook front-end for writing A* and way point generation.
