excerpt: 'Spherical,  toroidal,  and cylindrical manifolds, We present a surface modeling technique using manifolds. Our approach uses a single,  simple parameterization for all surfaces of a given genus. This differs from previous approaches which build a parameterization based on the elements of a mesh. The simple parameterization is more appropriate for applications that do complex operations in parameter space or on the mesh surface. We define a manifold and a corresponding embedding function for three genera (plane,  sphere,  and torus). The manifold can be used simply as a parameterization tool or as a smooth surface approximating the original mesh. We demonstrate how to build a correspondence between the mesh and the manifold,  then how to build an embedding that approximates the mesh.  Surface modeling,  parameterization, '
