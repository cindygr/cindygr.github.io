excerpt: 'Biological systems are organized along a hierarchy that ranges from bio-molecules to large-scale ecosystems. In the present work,  the level of biodiversity is considered as a source for engineering knowledge. In the process of evolution and adaptive radiation in particular,  common functional principles have been adapted to suit a multitude of tasks and constraints. The resulting biodiversity can hence be regarded as a source for inspiration on how a single functional principle can be adapted to suit the requirements of different applications. The biosonar systems of bats are an example for a biological sensing principle that has been adjusted to fit a multitude of sensing tasks. The unique combination of biosonar sensing and flight has allowed bats to settle almost the entire land surface of the earth and exploit a wide range of food sources that range from airborne insect prey to terrestrial vertebrates. The geometries of the mechanical baffles that surround the sides of sound emission and reception are a conspicuous correlate of this diversification in the uses of biosonar. Understand the principles that underlie this diversification,  requires an array of customized methods: First,  objective and quantitative descriptions are needed for the biological variation in irregular,  organic shapes at an inter-specific level. Second,  functional features of the sensors must be characterized in a similar fashion. Finally,  a link between form and function needs to be established. A description of the biodiversity in shape requires some form of registration between shapes from different species.
