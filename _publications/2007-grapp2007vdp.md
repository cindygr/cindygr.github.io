excerpt: 'Combines the previous several tech reports and poster presentation at Graphics Interface 2003 into one paper. We present a system for painting how the appearance of an object changes under different lighting and viewingconditions. The user paints what the object should look like under different lighting conditions (dark,  partiallydark,  fully lit,  etc.),  or different viewing angles,  or both. The system renders the object under new lightingconditions and a new viewing angle by combining these paintings. For surfaces without a pre-defined texturemap the system can construct texture maps directly from the user’s paintings. Texture mapping,  view-dependent painting, '
