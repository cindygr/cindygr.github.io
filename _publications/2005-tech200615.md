excerpt: 'Programming language approach to representing meshes, The Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) has been proposed as a system forexpressing inductively defined sets. I will present an inductive definition of the set of manifold meshes in LF. This definition takes into account the topological characterizationof meshes,  namely their Euler Characteristic.I will then present a set of dependent data types based on this inductive definition.These data types are defined in a programming language based on LF. Thelanguage’s type checking guarantees that any typeable expression represents a correctmanifold mesh. Furthermore,  any mesh can be represented using these data types.Hence,  the encoding is sound and complete., Meshes,  formal language theory,  proofs, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/932/, 52, '
