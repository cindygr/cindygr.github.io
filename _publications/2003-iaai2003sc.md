excerpt: 'The basic Lewis system. We have developed an autonomous robot system that takes well-composed photographs of people at social events,  such as weddings and conference receptions. The robot,  Lewis,  navigates through the environment,  opportunistically taking photographs of people. In this paper,  we outline the overall architecture of the system and describe how the various components inter-relate. We also describe our experiences of deploying the robot photographer at a number of real-world events.  Robots,  robot photography, '
