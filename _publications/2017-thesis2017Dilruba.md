excerpt: 'Published as a paper in Ubiquitous Robots 2018, Gender issues have recently received increased attention in human robot interaction(HRI). Because robots are becoming part of our homes and daily lives,  it isimportant to understand how di erent groups of people use them. To the bestof our knowledge,  almost no research has been done that investigates gender differencesin users information need,  information processing strategy,  self-e cacy, tinkering and their impact in human robot interaction. This thesis investigatesthese four aspects by examining object manipulation task from gender perspectiveusing a humanoid robot (PR2). We used both qualitative and quantitative approachesfor cross validation and methodological triangulation. Our experimentalresults show that females asked for more information before using the robot thanmales (p = 0.0002). Females processed information comprehensively and malesprocessed information selectively (p < 0.001) for using the robot. Males showedgreater self-e cacy than females (p = 0.0002). Males tinkered more with the robotthan females (p = 0.0021). We found that tinkering was positively correlated (p= 0.0068) with task success and negatively correlated (p = 0.0032) with taskcompletion time. Tinkering perhaps led to males greater task success and lowertask completion time with the robot. Findings from this research can be useful formaking design decisions for robots and open new research directions., https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/fb494f20n, '
