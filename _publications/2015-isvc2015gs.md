excerpt: 'Segmentation of volumetric images is considered a time and resource intensive bottleneck in scientific endeavors. Automatic methods are becoming more reliable,  but many data sets still require manual intervention. Key difficulties include navigating the 3D image,  determining where to place marks,  and maintaining consistency between marks and segmentations. Clinical practice often requires segmenting many different instances of a specific structure. In this research we leverage the similarity of a repeated segmentation task to address these difficulties and reduce the cognitive load for segmenting on non-traditional planes. We propose the idea of guided contouring protocols that provide guidance in the form of an automatic navigation path to arbitrary cross sections,  example marks from similar data sets,  and text instructions. We present a user study that shows the usability of this system with non-expert users in terms of segmentation accuracy,  consistency,  and efficiency.  , '
