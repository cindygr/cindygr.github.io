excerpt: 'An iterative implicit,  matrix solve of Andy\s journal of biomedical engineering paper, We propose the adaptation of mechanical strain to the problem of measuring similarity between non-rigid shapes and constructing shape correspondence. In the mechanics literature,  strain is a well-established technique for studying how a body deforms. The traditional de?nition applies to an n-D material embedded in n-D. In this paper,  we demonstrate how to de?ne strain for a 2D surface (either analytical or discrete,  i.e.  a mesh) embedded in 3D. We then demonstrate adjusting the correspondence between two surfaces so that the strain is evenly distributed across the surface.  shape matching,  correspondence, '
