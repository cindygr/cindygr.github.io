title: "Framing Effects on Privacy Concerns about a Home Telepresence Robot"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/3/2017-hri2017pc
excerpt: 'Privacy-sensitive robotics is an emerging area of HRI research. Judgments about privacy would seem to be context-dependent,  but none of the promising work on contextual \&quot;frames\&quot; has focused on privacy concerns. This work studies the impact of contextual \&quot;frames\&quot; on local users\ privacy judgments in a home telepresence setting. Our methodology consists of using an online questionnaire to collect responses to animated videos of a telepresence robot after framing people with an introductory paragraph. The results of four studies indicate a large effect of manipulating the robot operator\s identity between a stranger and a close confidante. It also appears that this framing effect persists throughout several videos. These findings serve to caution HRI researchers that a change in frame could cause their results to fail to replicate or generalize. We also recommend that robots be designed to encourage or discourage certain frames. privacy,  robotics, '
