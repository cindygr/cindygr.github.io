title: "A New Input Device for 3D Sketching"

excerpt: 'A novel sketch device using a piece of paper and a camera. We present a 3D input device consisting of a stiff piece of paper which is tracked by a digital video camera. The user can also draw on the paper using a pen-like device. The user moves the paper to specify the location of a virtual plane. By drawing on the paper,  the user can specify points in 3D space. The primary technical contribution of this paper is a new pose estimation algorithm suitable for a hand-held,  moving pattern. To demonstrate the usefulness of the device we developed a sketching application for simple characters. The characters are constructed by sketching and joining together 3D ellipses,  much as traditional cartoon characters are created in 2D using 2D ellipses.  Camera tracking,  sketching,  3D input device, '
