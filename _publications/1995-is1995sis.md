excerpt: 'Fitting S-patches to implicit surfaces,  We present a method for approximating an isosurface with a smooth parametric representation. From the isosurface we first produce a patch mesh,  a description of how many surface patches there are and how they are connected. We then create a smooth surface from the patch mesh.  3D surface modeling and editing, '
