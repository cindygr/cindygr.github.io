title: "An Education Model of Reasonable and Good-Faith Effort for Autonomous Systems"

excerpt: 'In this paper we propose a framework for conceptualizing and demonstrating a good-faith effort when developing autonomous systems. The framework addresses two fundamental problems facing autonomous systems: (1) the disconnect between human-mental models and machine-based sensors and algorithms; and (2) unpredictability in complex systems. We address these problems using a mix of education - explicitly delineating the mapping between human concepts and their machine equivalents in a structured manner - and data sampling with expected ranges as a testing mechanism. ethics,  mental models,  product law,  unit testing, '
