title: "Guiding Attention in Controlled Real-World Environments"

excerpt: 'The ability to direct a viewer\s attention has important applications in computer graphics,  data visualization,  image analysis,  and training. Existing computer-based gaze manipulation techniques,  which direct a viewer\s attention about a display,  have been shown to be effective for spatial learning,  search task completion,  and medical training applications. In this work we extend the concept of gaze manipulation beyond digital imagery to include controlled,  real-world environments. We address two main challenges in guiding attention to real-world objects: determining what object the viewer is currently paying attention to,  and providing (projecting) a visual cue on a different part of the scene in order to draw the viewer\s attention there. Our system consists of a pair of eye-tracking glasses to determine the viewer\s gaze location,  and a projector to create the visual cue in the physical environment. The results of a user study show that we can effectively direct the viewer\s gaze in the real-world scene. Our technique has applicability in a wide range of instructional environments,  including pilot training and driving simulators. SIFT,  eye-tracking,  gaze manipulation,  training, '
