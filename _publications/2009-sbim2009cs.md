excerpt: 'Software available  <a href = \&quot;http://volumeviewer.cse.wustl.edu/\&quot;>here</a>, Recent advances in surface reconstruction algorithms [BM07,  LBD? 08] allow surfaces to be built from contours lying on non-parallel planes. Such algorithms allow users to construct surfaces of similar quality more ef?ciently by using a small set of oblique contours,  rather than many parallel contours. However,  current medical imaging systems do not provide tools for sketching contours on oblique planes. In this paper,  we take the ?rst steps towards bridging the gap between the new surface reconstruction technologies and putting those methods to use in practice. We develop a novel interface for modeling surfaces from volume data by allowing the user to sketch contours on arbitrarily oriented cross-sections of the volume,  and we examine the users? ability to contour the same structures using oblique cross-sections with similar consistency as they can using parallel cross-sections. We measure the inter-observer and intra-observer variability of trained physicians contouring on oblique cross-sections of real patient data as compared to the traditional parallel cross-sections,  and show that the variation is much higher for oblique contouring. We then show that this variability can be greatly reduced by integrating a collection of training images into the interface.  Contouring,  user interfaces,  user studies,  oblique contouring,  sketching,  segmentation, '
