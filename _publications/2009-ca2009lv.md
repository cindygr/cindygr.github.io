excerpt: 'Real paintings are not truly flat but change subtly with variations in viewing direction. The pigments and painting layers also interact with the lighting environment,  producing changes that range from subtle to quite dramatic. These effects are lacking in digital images. This paper describes a system that allows an artist to introduce,  and control,  a variety of lighting and viewing effects,  such as specular reflection and refraction,  through the use of additional images. Diffuse reflection,  specular reflection,  lighting paintings, '
