excerpt: 'The goal of the Fingerspell Visualization Project is to research methods to improve learning of reading skills through sign language. The techniques are centered on Fingerspelling as the method to bridge stages of skill development. Visualization of a string of text in images of a hand performing the letters of the alphabet in standardized fingerspell sign language positions provide Full Motion Learning as opposed to learning from single pictures., https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/140/, '
