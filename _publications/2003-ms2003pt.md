excerpt: 'Using hyperbolic geometry to parameterize n-holed objects. We define a parameterization for an n-holed tori based on the hyperbolic polygon. We model the domain using a manifold with 2n+2 charts,  and linear fractional transformations for transition functions. We embed the manifold using standard spline techniques to produce a surface.  parameterization,  hyperbolic geometry,  n-holed tori, '
