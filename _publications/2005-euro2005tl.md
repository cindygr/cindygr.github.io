excerpt: 'Specifying lighting of real-world objects using a sketching approach. We apply simplified image-based lighting methods to reduce the equipment,  cost,  time,  and specialized skills required for high-quality photographic lighting of desktop-sized static objects such as museum artifacts. We place the object and a computer-steered moving-head spotlight inside a simple foam-core enclosure,  and use a camera to quickly record low-resolution photos as the light scans the box interior. Optimization guided by interactive user sketching selects a small set of frames whose weighted sum best matches the target image. The system then repeats the lighting used in each of these frames,  and constructs a high resolution result from re-photographed basis images. Unlike previous image-based re-lighting efforts,  our method requires only one light source,  yet can achieve high resolution light positioning to avoid multiple sharp shadows. A reduced version uses only a hand-held light,  and may be suitable for battery-powered,  field photography equipment that fits into a backpack.  lighting, '
