excerpt: 'Tracking a piece of paper as a drawing surface., The goal of this project is to develop a 3D input device using a stiff piece ofpaper and a camera. The camera tracks the piece of paper in 3D space. The userorients the paper in 3D space and then draws on the paper using a pen-like device. The camera tracks the movement of the pen on the piece of paper. The location of the pen in 3D space can then be calculated from the orientation of the paper.A drawing application that uses this 3D input device was also developed. Theapplication allows a user to make characters by sketching ellipses. The drawing application creates a virtual rendering of the paper and displays this to the user. As the user positions the real paper,  the virtual one mirrors its movements. The user can draw shapes on the paper. These shapes then get rendered in the virtual scene., Tracking,  3D drawing , https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/1068/, '
