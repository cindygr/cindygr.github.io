excerpt: 'A 3D camera calibration pattern, We describe a new pose estimation approach for a 3D object capture system. This 3D pose estimation approach offers several advantages: increased visibility,  robustness to lighting conditions,  and improved reliability with evenly distributed errors. The calibration pattern is built using 3D conic features. We use simplex search to find the camera position and orientations that minimizes the error between the projected 3D cone features and the corresponding 2D image features. We demonstrate that our approach is accurate,  efficient and robust.  Camera tracking,  sketching,  3D input device, '
