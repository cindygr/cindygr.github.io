excerpt: 'The internals of the robot photographer system, We describe a complete,  end-to-end system for taking well-composed photographs using a mobile robot. The general scenario is a reception,  or other event,  where people are roaming around talking to each other. The robot serves as an ``event photographer\\\\\\,  roaming around the same space as the participants,  periodically taking photographs. These images are then sent to a workstation where participants can print the photographs out,  or email them.  Robot systems,  navigation,  photographer, '
