excerpt: 'Using level sets to evolve surfaces, Level set models are deformable implicit surfaces where the deformation is controlled by a speed function in the level set partial differential equation (PDE). These models are widely used in computer graphics applications due to their implicit de?nition,  low-level volumetric representation and the powerful numerical techniques used to produce the PDE-based deformation. We present a set of interactive sketch-based level-set surface editing operators. These operators allow a user to sketch curves above or on a level-set surface in order to edit the surface?s shape. Once the curves are sketched the surface interactively evolves to locally ?t to the curves. A user may then modify the curves in order to re?ne the shape of the model. The mathematics,  algorithms and techniques needed to implement numerous sketch-based level set modeling capabilities are described. The speed functions that produce the surface deformations within the context of solving the level-set PDE are detailed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the ?exibility and usefulness of the editing operators.  Sketching,  level-sets,  surface editing, '
