excerpt: 'This is the paper version of the tech report. The full details can be found in Nisha\s thesis. Viewing data sampled on complicated geometry,  such as a helix or atorus,  is hard because a single camera view can only encompass a partof the object. Either multiple views or non-linear projection can beused to expose more of the object in a single view,  however, specifying such views is challenging because of the large number ofparameters involved.  We show that a small set of versatile widgetscan be used to quickly and simply specify a wide variety of suchviews. These widgets are built on top of a general framework that inturn encapsulates a variety of complicated camera placement issuesinto a more natural set of parameters,  making the specification of newwidgets,  or combining multiple widgets,  simpler. This framework isentirely view-based and leaves intact the underlying geometry of thedataset,  making it applicable to a wide range of data types. Non-linear perspective,  user interfaces,  visualization,  camera control,  rendering, '
