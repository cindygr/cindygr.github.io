excerpt: 'This is the poster version of the full technical report. More details <a href=\&quot;drawing.htm\&quot;> here </a>, We present the results of an observational study on sketching. Artists were asked to sketch a small number of objects and comment on how and why they made the marks they did. We summarize these findings,  from low-level details on individual marks through the drawing construction order. Based on these observations we provide suggestions for future research directions in 3D sketching. Sketching,  stroke,  marks, '
