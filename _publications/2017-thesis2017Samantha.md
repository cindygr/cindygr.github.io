excerpt: 'Soft robotics is an emerging field that heavily relies on the ability of 3D printers. The limitations in soft robotics lie in the area of the 3D printers and the predictive models of the printed materials. There are currently no reliable models for optimizing the gradients required to create soft robots. These gradients are necessary to go from soft to hard materials which are used in electronics and soft robotics grips. This is achievable with the soft materials printed by the Stratasys Objet 500 Connex3,  which can print a gradient in materials from hard to soft. Here we show the ability to print a homogeneous gradient on the printer,  characterize these homogeneous materials,  and model the optimized parameters of the nonlinear elastic material model according to techniques based upon Ogden., https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/s4655k29q, '
