excerpt: 'CubeCam for single camera control and a framework for non-linear projection. CubeCam was published in Computational Aesthetics, 2009,  the curved perspective in Eurographics short papers 2005,  and the non-linear perspective rendering in NPAR 2008., Camera manipulation is a hard problem since a graphics camera is defined by specifying 11 independent parameters. Manipulating such a high-dimensional space to accomplish specific tasks is difficult and requires a certain amount of expertise. We present an intuitive interface that allows novice users to perform camera operations in terms of the change they want see in the image. In addition to developing a naturalmeans for camera interaction,  our system also includes a novel interface for viewing and organizing previously saved views. When exploring complex 3D data-sets a single view is not sufficient. Instead,  a composite view built from multiple views may be more useful. While changing a single camera is hard enough,  manipulating several cameras in a single scene is still harder. In this thesis,  we also present a framework for creating composite views and an interface that allows users to manipulate such views in real-time., Camera control and non-linear perspective, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/196/, '
