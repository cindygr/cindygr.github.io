title: "Contact Areas and Ligament Lengths are Abnormal in Patients with Malunited Distal Radius Fracture Despite Normal Radioulnar Kinematics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/8/2002-wcb2002ca
excerpt: 'First draft of the IEEE paper. Altered kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and/or bone impingement are considered causes of long-term complications associated with malunited distal radius fractures. However,  a  CT image-based in vivo study of patients with malunited distal radius fractures found that malunion did not alter forearm kinematics and that limitations of pronosupination were not caused by bony impingement (Moore et al.  . In this study,  data from the previous study was reanalyzed to explore focal changes in the articulation at the DRUJ (location and area of bone contact) and potential soft tissue constraints (\\\length\\\ of the dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligaments).  , '
