title: "Using Texture Synthesis for Non-Photorealistic Shading from Paint Samples"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/10/2003-pg2003uts
excerpt: 'Shading using texture, This paper presents several methods for shading meshes from scanned paint samples that represent dark to light transitions. Our techniques emphasize artistic control of brush stroke texture and color. We first demonstrate how the texture of the paint sample can be separated from its color gradient. We demonstrate three methods,  two real-time and one off-line for producing rendered,  shaded images from the texture samples. All three techniques use texture synthesis to generate additional paint samples. Finally,  we develop metrics for evaluating how well each method achieves our goal in terms of texture similarity,  shading correctness and temporal coherence. Texture synthesis,  non-photorealistic rendering, '
