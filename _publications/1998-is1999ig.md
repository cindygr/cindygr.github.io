excerpt: 'Creating sweep surfaces using sketching, We introduce an implicit generalized cylinder which is constructed from an axis and one or more profile curves. This surface is related to the sweep which is traditionally formed by an axis curve and one or more cross sections. Instead of cross sections,  this definition uses profile curves to define how far the surface is from the axis. This facilitates the construction of surfaces which have continually varying cross sections. We extend this definition to a generalized cylinder with two axis curves. This model is useful for surfaces where one side of the surface curves sharply away from the axis while the axis itself is curving. We also present a user interface for editing these sweeps.  3D surface modeling and editing, '
