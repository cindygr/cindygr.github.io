excerpt: 'Interaction observations with Lewis the robot photographer, We have deployed a robot ``photographer\\\\\\ at several events. The robot,  Lewis,  navigates through the space,  opportunistically taking photographs of people. We summarize the different types of human-robot interactions we have observed at these events,  and put forth some possible explanations for the different behaviors. We also discuss potential models for human-robot interactions in this constrained setting.  Human-computer interaction,  robotics,  path planning, '
