excerpt: 'The original manifold-style surface modeling paper, We describe an extension of B-splines to surfaces of arbitrary topology,  including arbitrary boundaries. The technique inherits many of the properties of B-splines: local control,  a compact representation,  and guaranteed continuity of arbitrary degree. The surface is specified using a polyhedral control mesh instead of a rectangular one; the resulting surface approximates the polyhedral mesh much as a B-spline approximates its rectangular control mesh. Like a B-spline,  the surface is a single,  continuous object. This is achieved by modeling the domain of the surface with a manifold whose topology matches that of the polyhedral mesh,  then embedding this domain into 3-space using a basis-function/control-point formulation. We provide a constructive approach to building a manifold.  3D surface modeling and editing, '
