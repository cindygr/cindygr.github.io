excerpt: 'Non-photorealistic techniques combining shading with texture. Published in Pacific Graphics, 2003, The goal of this research is to explore techniques for shading 3D computer generated models using scanned images of actual paint samples. The techniques presented emphasize artistic control of brush stroke texture and color. We first demonstrate how the texture of a paint sample can be separated from its color transition. Four methods,  three real-time and one off-line,  for producing rendered images from the paint samples are then presented. Finally,  we develop metrics for evaluating how welleach method achieves our goal in terms of texture similarity,  shading correctness,  and temporal coherence., 3D painting,  texture synthesis,  shading, https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/1108/'
