I work in the area of robotic grasping and manipulation for agriculture, as well as ethics, law and policy related to robotics. My previous projects include: modeling the developing heart, understanding how the shape of bat ears influences their sonar patterns, art-based rendering, 3D sketching, and interfaces for 3D medical image segmentation. I received my PhD from Brown University in 1995 in the area of surface modeling, spent two years working at Microsoft Research on facial animation, then ten years as faculty in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am now in the Mechanical Engineering department at Oregon State University.
